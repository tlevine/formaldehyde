For privacy: Locations are zip codes.

Do any data need to be private?

We would like to ask lots of questions of people, but that could get daunting. People may come back many times because they are interested in their health, and we can ask the questions gradually.

A diary of stories and symtoms, related to zip code weather, would collect wonderful data. It could help with the science a lot and might feel cathartic.

Attempts to remediate (like with plants)


User registrations would be nice. But not quite necessary because VINs are long.

Information to collect

* Phone number
* Email address

First website, then phone number?
